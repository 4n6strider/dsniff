intercept packets on a switched LAN
.SH SYNOPSIS

.fi
\fBarpspoof\fR [-v] [\fB-i \fIinterface\fR] [\fB-c \fIown|host|both\fR] [\fB-s \fInetwork/prefixlength\fR] [\fB-t \fItarget\fR] [\fB-r\fR] \fIhost\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
\fBarpspoof\fR redirects packets from a target host (or all hosts)
on the LAN intended for another host on the LAN by forging ARP
replies.  This is an extremely effective way of sniffing traffic on a
switch.
.LP
Kernel IP forwarding (or a userland program which accomplishes the
same, e.g. fragrouter(8)) must be turned on ahead of time.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-v\fR"
Make arpspoof verbose about what it is doing.
.IP "\fB-i \fIinterface\fR"
Specify the interface to use.
.IP "\fB-c \fIown|host|both\fR"
Specify which hardware address t use when restoring the arp configuration;
while cleaning up, packets can be send with the own address as well as with
the address of the host. Sending packets with a fake hw address can disrupt
connectivity with certain switch/ap/bridge configurations, however it works
more reliably than using the own address, which is the default way arpspoof
cleans up afterwards.
.IP "\fB-t \fItarget\fR"
Specify a particular host to ARP poison (if not specified, all hosts
on the LAN). Repeat to specify multiple hosts.
.IP "\fB-s \fInetwork/prefixlength\fR"
Specify a network in CIDR notation to poison. An arpscan is performed to
locate active hosts in the network.
.IP "\fB-r\fR"
Poison both hosts (host and target) to capture traffic in both directions.
(only valid in conjuntion with -t)
.IP \fIhost\fR
Specify the host you wish to intercept packets for (usually the local
gateway).
